CPF and CNPJ User Extension for Selenium IDE 
============================================

Official documentation about User Extensions:

The source-code of this user extension was created by Maur√≠cio Avellar and shared in this link http://www.seuenium.com.br/2009/05/20/novos-comandos-do-selenium-para-gerar-cpf-e-cnpj/ (unfortunately this is not working anymore).

The code was refactored to accept the Selenium storeEval() command.
